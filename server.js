Wrapped in warmth and firmly rooted. Envisioning a woman who is going through the motions of better understanding and loving herself even more. Surrounded by love in all forms. Surrounded by a community of family (chosen or blood) who truly see her, and believe in her. This blessing of life is stepping deep within my bones and I am gracefully journeying with it.",

Throughout 25 I discovered how important it is to get rid of those funky people in your life who are unsupportive, aren't accountable, abusive, jealous, competitive, materialistic, negative, gossips and gaslights. Make room for those who align with your path, goals and values. People you feel safe with. Peole who show you love through actions, not just empty words. People who want to understand who you are instead of projecting what they want to see. I promise you, they exist. Working on my own healing I started meeting such amazing people and attracting such good opportunities and also found myself in healthy, positive spaces. Know how to hold space for good people who will celebrate you, genuinely. Yet, also allow yourself to feed on positivity as strongly as you can so you attract the good.",

Basically, represent yourself so well that they don’t even have time to think about your age but respect your maturity in the Lord which I love. I resonate so well with this verse in many ways but reflecting in it all from how I conduct myself, how both purely joyful and fantastic existing relationships (and the failed ones) I learn to move in life with so many love for myself and others. When you go into any situation with pure intention and it is not received you learn that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Focusing on your side of the lawn and watering your own BUT watering those who appreciate allows for your energy to refocus on the blessings around you.",

God is strategic, so great and consistent and will always set the tone so you better understand situations you find yourself in. Remember he is the ultimate love.",

    subTitle: "Your career path and what led you to what you’re doing today?",
    content: "I’ve always known that I want to work in fashion and creative spaces for as long as I can remember. Growing up I’ve always wanted to be a Fashion Designer (still my biggest dream). And I got exposed to the industry even more. I got to engage with all aspects of it from both a practical and theory part. I slowly did fashion styling, gradually moving towards being a blogger and learning about the digital world. Eventually it all just started making sense to where I am now. I still have so many things that I want to achieve within my career but to date I’m living my dream.",

  {
    subTitle: "What do you love about social media? And, how has it changed since you began your career?",
    content: "I jumped onto social media platforms very early on, creating for upcoming clothing brands and also content creating for other individuals. When I started being more intentional about growing Haut I got even more comfortable creating my own content. It had a whole new purpose — a new outlet for me to grow and express my creative thoughts and share what I love. I would have always found a way to slot myself within the industry, but social media gave a voice to those who were starting out and not afraid which I’ve always appreciated about it. I also have such a great community of supporters on there.",

  {
    subTitle: "How has your style and aesthetic evolved?",
    content: "I think I have always stuck to my rule of ‘less is more’. I may lean towards different tones and shapes depending on the year, season or trend, but ultimately I go back to a real simple aesthetic. I’m such a minimalist at heart and I love the calm it gives me."

  {
    subTitle: "Tips for someone who wants to do Digital Marketing?",
    content: "Listen, I am no expert in the field. From my experience it’s been a learning, unlearning experience. The best advice I can give is to work hard. Research, network and create. I am currently studying so that I’m able to understand even better so do whatever you can to learn and grow in what you’re doing. Did I mention create? What helped me most was designing and learning about the different softwares available. Educating myself on all things marketing and even understanding clients and how businesses function off from marketing. You really learn so much once you commit and dedicate to the course of it all.",

  {
    subTitle: "Do you plan your content? What do you use to take your pictures.",
    content: "Brand work I do love to plan around. I enjoy creating a moodboard around the brand brief and create content around it. For my own work I just love allowing things to flow especially when it’s just an outfit of the day look it’s a simple snap and share.",
  },
  {
    subTitle: "Love your aesthetic. How do you stay disciplined to it?",
    content: "Thank you! I get asked this all the time. I am living my aesthetic to be honest. I sometimes find that it randomly catches up to me, if that makes sense. It comes naturally and I just have a flow to it. I don’t like overthinking it, so I just allow myself to freely do what I want when it comes to it and when I do pay attention it’s consistent.",
